# AgroVision: Mobile Development ðŸ¤–â™Ÿ

AgroVision's Mobile Development team is responsible for developing a mobile application that detects plant diseases through leaf image analysis using Kotlin. The following are the steps taken by the team: designing an intuitive and attractive user interface using Figma, then developing the application by coding, then implementing the design into a real application using Kotlin. We also set up key features such as disease detection and analysis history storage. In addition, we prepared code to integrate machine learning and APIs. Integrating machine learning models using TensorFlow Lite and connecting the application with the necessary APIs.

## Features
